## Todo

@todo Seems to run sound twice after resume - is it not clearning interval timer, maybe it
doesn't need to run again, maybe it justs needs to reset timer on resum

## Ideas

Time limit option, say "YOu have x minutes left"
Then `You've gone over by x minutes`
window that tells you how long it's been
Dialog that asks you if you are working
Save the time elapsed all day and display
Have a over all time warning
Show time have been working all week
Show a warning message
